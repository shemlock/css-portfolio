## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?

  Creating this website helped me learn about: 
  * Flex Box
  * Grid
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Media Querys 

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
