## Description

The motivation for this project was to build a portfolio website, so that I could showcase my skills and talents to potential employers.

I wanted to create this website because having a portfolio with deployed web applications is beneficial for my career search journey, as employers can get a better idea of who I am and what I can do. 

  Creating this website helped me learn about: 
  * Flex Box
  * Grid
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Media Querys
  * How to style a website to match the given wireframe.
